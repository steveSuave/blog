This website is just another programmer's blog.

Its name was inspired from the propositions of Euclid's Elements but, in contrast to Euclid's template of presenting explicitly stated theorems followed by rigorous proofs, the content presented here is planned to be much more informal.

My intention for this blog is to be a place where I collect my attempts to understand and explain, to any web visitor or my future self, various topics that interest me but I don't necessarily get to enjoy in my everyday work as a programmer.

<!-- If a post of mine intrigues someone enough to send me an email, this would be a (hopefully happy) side-effect. -->
